# Template for Each of OUR Internal APPS

## Don't confuse this with the "apps" that people build with our system

Our apps are Intelligence, AI APPS, PRODUCTIVITY, TOOLS, INTEGRATIONS, MATRIX ENGINE, ETC.

-   Within each app, we have many modules and the handling of these needs to be templated in many ways.

# Core Concepts:

-   Templated apps
-   REUSE, REUSE and REUSE!
-   For each component or group of components, we need to create reusable parts that can be used in other apps.
-   Each app will be different in many ways, but the look and feel needs to be the same everywhere
-   The purpose of this template is to show the basic structure we want

-   But I ran out of time to customize it today!
